# Mobile Chat Architecture Migration Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of migrating mobile chat from the old flat structure to the proper subfeature organization that matches desktop architecture.

## Migration Strategy
- **Incremental Migration**: One subfeature at a time to minimize risk
- **Functional Preservation**: No functionality breaks during migration
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing imports until migration is complete
- **Gradual Refactoring**: Step-by-step adjustments
